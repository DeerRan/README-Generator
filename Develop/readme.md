## Description

## Demo

## Usage
This application can be used once you are done with a project. Simply install the project and run "node index.js" in order to begin generating the README.
## Contribution
I'm not really looking for feedback on this project. It's not something I made for fun or to make look nice, but rather it was just required of me. (it's also useful for the future)

## References
Old-Prego's generator helped me work through some of my issue and was a great reference.
## Note to graders 
For future assignments, I will be adding a note because I'm not sure if it's the same people grading my assignments or different people.
Anyways, the reason why this assignment is so late is due to some complications in my family. As a result, my homeworks got delayed and I haven't been able to be where I would have desired. I just wanted to apologize to whoever is grading this and my upcoming late assignments.
